## Functional requirements

The company wants to invest in owning their infrastructure.
The reason is because there is a concern about the privacy of 
user data and also a concern that the cost of managed services 
for GenAI will greatly raise in cost.

They want to invest in AI local server where they can afford
spend of 10-15k
They have 300 active students, and student are located within the city of Bangkok.

## Assumptions
We are assuming that the open source LLMs that we choose will be powerful enough to run on hardware with an investment of 10-15k.

We're just going to hook up a single server in our office to the internet and we should have enough bandwidth to serve the 300 students.

## Data strategy

There is a concern of copytrighted materials, so we must purchase and supply materials and store them for access in our database.
